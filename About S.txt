Ilaiyaraaja was born as Gnanathesigan in a Dalit family[4] belonging to Pannaipuram, in present-day Theni district, Tamil Nadu, India, 
on 3 June 1943.[5][6] In his later years, Ilaiyaraaja started to celebrate his birthday on 2 June instead, so that people of Tamil Nadu can
celebrate only that of Karunanidhi on 3 June, as both their birthdays fall on the same date. It was done out of respect for the late 
politician who bestowed him the title "Isaignani".[7]

At the time of joining school, his father changed his name from Gnanathesigan to "Rajaiya", and the people in his village called him 
"Raasayya".[8] When he joined Dhanraj Master as a student to learn musical instruments, the master changed his name to "Raaja".[9] While 
working for his first film Annakili, Tamil film producer Panchu Arunachalam added the prefix "Ilaiya" (Ilaiya meaning younger in Tamil 
language) to the name Raaja, and renamed him as "Ilaiyaraaja", as in the 1970s there was another popular music director with the same 
suffix, namely A. M. Rajah.[10]
