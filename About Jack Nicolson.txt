John Joseph Nicholson was born on April 22, 1937, in Neptune City, New Jersey,[5][6][7] the son of a showgirl, June Frances Nicholson 
(stage name June Nilson; 1918–1963).[8][9] Nicholson's mother was of Irish, English, German, and Welsh descent. Nicholson has identified 
as Irish, comparing himself to the playwright Eugene O'Neill, whom he played in the film Reds: "I'm not saying I'm as dark as he was... but
 I am a writer, I am Irish, I have had problems with my family."[10] His mother married Italian-American showman Donald Furcillo 
(stage name Donald Rose; 1909–1997) in 1936, before realizing that he was already married.[11]: 8 [12] Biographer Patrick McGilligan 
stated in his book Jack's Life that Latvian-born Eddie King (originally Edgar A. Kirschfeld),[13] June's manager, may have been Nicholson's
 biological father, rather than Furcillo. Other sources suggest June Nicholson was unsure of the father's identity.[8] As June was only 17
 and unmarried, her parents[note 1] agreed to raise Nicholson as their own child without revealing his true parentage, with June acting as
 his sister.[14] In 1974, Time magazine researchers learned, and informed Nicholson, that his "sister", June, was actually his mother, and
 his other "sister", Lorraine, was really his aunt.[15] By this time, both his mother and grandmother had died (in 1963 and 1970, 
respectively). On finding out, Nicholson said it was "a pretty dramatic event, but it wasn't what I'd call traumatizing ... I was pretty
 well psychologically formed".[14]

Nicholson grew up in Neptune City.[11]: 7  He was raised in his mother's Roman Catholic Church.[16][17] Before starting high school, his
family moved to an apartment in Spring Lake, New Jersey.[11]: 16  "When Jack was ready for high school, the family moved once more—this 
time two miles farther south to old-money Spring Lake, New Jersey's so-called Irish Riviera, where his grandmother, Ethel May, set up her 
beauty parlor in a rambling duplex at 505 Mercer Avenue."[18] "Nick", as he was known to his high school friends, attended nearby Manasquan
 High School, where he was voted "Class Clown" by the Class of 1954. He was in detention every day for a whole school year.[7] A theatre 
and a drama award at the school are named in his honor. In 2004, Nicholson attended his 50-year high school reunion accompanied by his aunt
 Lorraine.[11]

In 1957, Nicholson joined the California Air National Guard,[19] a move he sometimes characterized as an effort to "dodge the draft";[20] 
the Korean War–era's Military Selective Service Act was still in force, and draftees were required to perform up to two years of active 
duty. After completing the Air Force's basic training at Lackland Air Force Base,[20] Nicholson performed weekend drills and two-week 
annual training as a firefighter assigned to the unit based at the Van Nuys Airport.[20] During the Berlin Crisis of 1961, Nicholson was 
called up for several months of extended active duty,[20] and he was discharged at the end of his enlistment in 1962.[21]
